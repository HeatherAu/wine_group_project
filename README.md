# wine_group_project

Intro should be done

Changed the visualization to compare multiple attributes to alcohol content
The data was scaled and changed before plotting (through facet_wrap)

For preliminary data analysis...
    - Created a table that reports the number of observation in each attribute
    - Found the average of each attribute
    - Found the number of na (which is 0)

Did tidying of the data (just making wine a factor for future classification)
Revised the introduction
Split the wine_tidy data intro training and testing data so the training data can be summarized

Did some formatting and added in the stuff we needed to do, pls add ur student # in :)

Added student number, and Method & Expected Outcomes and Significance

Still need student number and the last part of expected outcomes and significance
