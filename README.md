# group_report
Created the classifer and confusion matrix as well as evaluate the accuracy, precision and recall
Added narration but still needs to be proofread
Discussion still needs to be written

Added narration to how we found our predictors + citations (also make sure to add set.seed (999) so we don't get different results everytime the code is ran)

Added a way to find a good subset of predictors

Got rid of rubric items and putting our response in an indented quote block

# wine_group_project
Added commentary of visuals and tables (in progress)

Intro should be done

Changed the visualization to compare multiple attributes to alcohol content
The data was scaled and changed before plotting (through facet_wrap)

For preliminary data analysis...
    - Created a table that reports the number of observation in each attribute
    - Found the average of each attribute
    - Found the number of na (which is 0)

Did tidying of the data (just making wine a factor for future classification)
Revised the introduction
Split the wine_tidy data intro training and testing data so the training data can be summarized

Did some formatting and added in the stuff we needed to do, pls add ur student # in :)

Added student number, and Method & Expected Outcomes and Significance

Still need student number and the last part of expected outcomes and significance 
Also wrote my changes underneath
